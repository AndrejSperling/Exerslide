A javascript framework for adding augmented reality content to web applications

## Beschreibung
Augmented reality (AR) is the idea of mixing computer-generated media (e.g., 3D objects, 2D content, spatialized audio) with someone’s view of the real world. Whether you want to create a new AR application, or add an AR view to an existing web application, the argon.js framework provides a set of abstractions and utilities for adding an AR view to your web application in a platform- and technology-independent way.

argon.js was originally designed to take advantage of the augmented reality capabilities of the Argon AR-enabled web browser on iOS, simplifying the process of delivering mobile AR experiences without the need to create, ship and support native applications.

However, argon.js will also work with other web browsers, taking advantage of their capabilities to allow your application to deliver whatever kind of AR experience each browser is capable of. While the AR capabilities a most web browsers is currently minimal, they are improving rapidly, and argon.js is designed to support this evolution.
